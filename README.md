# WineQualityPrediction

#About the Project

To predict the quality of wines (Either good or bad) using different classifier models and determine which features are good/bad for the Good Quality Wines and bad for Bad Quality wines.

#Details about the project:

For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine quality dataset(Link for the Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/data ) to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). 

The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:
1.Fixed acidity
2.Volatile acidity
3.Citric acid
4.Residual sugar
5.Chlorides
6.Free sulfur dioxide
7.Total sulfur dioxide
8.Density
9.pH
10.sulfates
11.Alcohol
